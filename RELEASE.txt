1.1: Refactoring of finite field internals
- Finite field operations are now defined by individual specializations of
  templated functions
- Remove DEFINE_FINITE_FIELD macro
- Move Mersenne61 and Mersenne127 definitions into ff.h

1.0: Initial public version of SCL.
- Features:
  - Math:
    - Finite Field class with two instantiations based on Mersenne primes
    - Ring modulo 2^K, with support for any K less than or equal to 128
    - Vectors. This is a thinish wrapper around an STL vector
    - Matrices
    - All math types support serialization
  - Primitives:
    - PRG based on AES-CTR
    - IUF Hash based on SHA3
  - Networking:
    - Basic support for peer-to-peer communication via TCP. Channels are
      designed in such a way that writing custom ones (or decorators for
      existing channels) is easy
    - Peer discovery functionality to make it easier to setup working networks
  - Secret Sharing:
    - Shamir secret sharing with support for both error detection and correction
    - Additive secret sharing
- Development:
  - Decent code coverage
  - Documentation
